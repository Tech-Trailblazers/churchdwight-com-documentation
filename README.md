# 🌍 Church & Dwight SDS / MSDS Documentation

⚠️ **Because safety data should be open, accessible, and useful for everyone.**

This repository is a **community-driven archive** of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for **Church & Dwight products**.  
We collect, organize, and share these documents so that **families, students, researchers, emergency responders, and developers** can all benefit.

Think of it as a **public library of chemical safety knowledge** 📚 — available to anyone, anywhere.

## 📑 What are SDS / MSDS?

- **SDS (Safety Data Sheet)** and **MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)** are standardized documents created by manufacturers.
- They include information like:
  - 🧪 Chemical composition
  - ⚡ Hazard classification
  - 💊 First aid & emergency measures
  - 🧯 Firefighting guidance
  - 📦 Storage & handling rules
  - ♻️ Safe disposal instructions

In short: **If something goes wrong with a product, the SDS is the “instruction manual” for keeping people safe.**

## 💡 Why Does This Project Exist?

Because **safety knowledge saves lives.** 🫶

Too often, SDS documents are:

- Hidden deep inside corporate websites 🔍
- Published only as hard-to-read PDFs 📄
- Not accessible to communities that need them most 🌐

We believe that by **organizing and opening up this data**, we can:

- 📚 Help teachers & students learn real-world chemistry and toxicology
- 🤖 Power AI/ML models that understand hazards & safety language
- 🏥 Support first responders, poison control, and healthcare workers in emergencies
- 🏡 Give families the tools to handle household products more safely
- 🌍 Empower global communities who may lack easy access to chemical safety info

This project is about more than just documents — it’s about **protecting families and building safer communities worldwide.** ❤️
